Welcome to **Awesome Startup Global Explorer**, your ultimate gateway to navigating the global startup ecosystem. Whether you're an early-stage founder seeking seed funding, or a scaling tech company looking for government grants and top-tier VCs, this platform centralizes **35,000+ funding opportunities across 188+ countries**.

![Demo Dashboard](demo_en.png)

## 🏢 About Genox

**Genox** is an innovative tech venture based in Seoul, South Korea. We architect data-driven solutions and platforms that empower global startups. We believe in democratizing access to opportunities, breaking down borders, and accelerating innovation.

We spent countless hours scouring government portals, VC databases, and accelerator sites across dozens of countries. We built this tool internally first, and now we're open-sourcing it because **every founder deserves access to global opportunities**, not just those in Silicon Valley.

## 🚀 What Does This Site Let You Do?

Finding the right funding or support program can be overwhelming, especially when looking across borders. This application solves that by doing the heavy lifting for you:

### 1. Discover Global Funding Instantly
Explore a massive, continuously updated database of:
- **Government Grants** (e.g., SBIR in the US, Innovate UK, K-Startup in Korea, Horizon Europe)
- **VCs & Accelerators** (Y Combinator, Techstars, 500 Global, and thousands of regional micro-VCs)
- **Corporate Open Innovation (OI)** programs
- **Cloud Credits & Perks** (AWS Activate, Google for Startups)
- **Relocation & Growth** initiatives (Startup Visas, Tech Hub Residencies)

### 2. Native Multi-Language Support (Breaking Down Borders)
We recognize that the next big unicorn could come from anywhere. However, the global startup ecosystem has historically been gatekept by a severe language barrier—with critical funding portals, grant details, and VC investment theses often buried in English or local dialects. To ensure absolutely no founder is left behind, our platform features an incredibly powerful, industry-leading **Native Multi-Language Support System**.

With a single click on our top navigation bar, you can seamlessly translate the entire platform—including all **35,000+ deeply nested program descriptions, criteria, and dynamic database entries**—into:
- 🇺🇸 **English** (Universal Default)
- 🇰🇷 **한국어 (Korean)**
- 🇨🇳 **中文 (Simplified Chinese)** & 🇹🇼 **繁體中文 (Traditional Chinese)**
- 🇪🇸 **Español (Spanish)**
- 🇦🇪 **العربية (Arabic)**
- 🇩🇪 **Deutsch (German)**
- 🇫🇷 **Français (French)**
- 🇮🇳 **हिन्दी (Hindi)**
- 🇮🇩 **Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)**
- 🇮🇹 **Italiano (Italian)**
- 🇯🇵 **日本語 (Japanese)**
- 🇵🇹 **Português (Portuguese)**
- 🇷🇺 **Русский (Russian)**
- 🇹🇭 **ไทย (Thai)**
- 🇹🇷 **Türkçe (Turkish)**
- 🇻🇳 **Tiếng Việt (Vietnamese)**
*(And we are continuously working to add more!)*

**Why is this revolutionary?**
Most startup databases only translate their static UI (buttons, menus) while leaving the actual data (which matters most) in its original language. Our platform solves this using a **dual-engine translation architecture**:
1. **Static UI Localization:** Powered by `Flask-Babel`, ensuring all structural elements, navigation, and core UX are perfectly localized with zero latency using pre-compiled `.po` and `.mo` message catalogs.
2. **Dynamic Data Translation:** Powered by an asynchronous pipeline utilizing `deep-translator`. When you switch languages, our system fetches the live, unstructured program descriptions from our SQLite database and translates them on-the-fly, preserving exact data schemas, markdown formatting, and critical funding criteria.

This means a founder in Bogota, Riyadh, or Seoul can read the complex compliance requirements of a US SBIR grant, or the investment thesis of a London-based VC network, in their native tongue as effortlessly as a founder in San Francisco. It entirely removes the friction of cross-border fundraising.

### 3. Smart "Relevance Score" Ranking
Not all programs are created equal. Our custom `fit_score` algorithm evaluates opportunities and automatically bubbles up the highest-tier, most active programs to the top, so you don't waste time scrolling through dead links.

### 4. Powerful Filtering & Search
Need a FinTech grant in LatAm? Or an AI accelerator in Asia? Use the intuitive UI to filter by Country/Region, Category, Industry, and Deadlines.

### 5. Direct "Apply" Portals
When you find the perfect match, click "Apply" to be taken *directly* to the official application portal.
