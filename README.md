Welcome to **Awesome Awesome Startup Global Explorer Explorer**, your ultimate gateway to navigating the global startup ecosystem. Whether you're an early-stage founder seeking seed funding, or a scaling tech company looking for government grants and top-tier VCs, this platform centralizes **33,000+ funding opportunities across 188+ countries**.

##  Why We Built This

As a startup based in Seoul, South Korea ([Genox Holdings](https://genoxholdings.com)), we spent countless hours scouring government portals, VC databases, and accelerator sites across dozens of countries. We built this tool internally first, and now we're open-sourcing it because **every founder deserves access to global opportunities**, not just those in Silicon Valley.

##  What Does This Site Let You Do?

Finding the right funding or support program can be overwhelming, especially when looking across borders. This application solves that by doing the heavy lifting for you:

### 1.  **Discover Global Funding Instantly**
Explore a massive, continuously updated database of:
- **Government Grants** (e.g., SBIR in the US, Innovate UK, K-Startup in Korea, Horizon Europe)
- **VCs & Accelerators** (Y Combinator, Techstars, 500 Global, and thousands of regional micro-VCs)
- **Corporate Open Innovation (OI)** programs
- **Cloud Credits & Perks** (AWS Activate, Google for Startups)
- **Relocation & Growth** initiatives (Startup Visas, Tech Hub Residencies)

### 2.  **Smart "Relevance Score" Ranking**
Not all programs are created equal. Our custom `fit_score` algorithm evaluates opportunities and automatically bubbles up the highest-tier, most active programs to the top, so you don't waste time scrolling through dead links.

### 3.  **Native Multi-Language Support**
Startup ecosystems shouldn't be gated by language barriers. With a single click on our top navigation bar, you can seamlessly translate the entire platform and all 33,000+ program descriptions into:
- **English** | **한국어 (Korean)** | **中文 (Chinese)** | **Español (Spanish)** | **العربية (Arabic)** 
*(And many more!)*

### 4.  **Powerful Filtering & Search**
Need a FinTech grant in LatAm? Or an AI accelerator in Asia? Use the intuitive UI to filter by:
- **Country / Region** (188+ specific countries or "Global" remote programs)
- **Category** (Gov Grants, VCs, Corporate, etc.)
- **Industry** (AI, FinTech, SaaS, DeepTech, HealthTech, Web3, CleanTech, etc.)
- **Deadline** (Rolling vs. Fixed Deadlines)

### 5.  **Direct "Apply" Portals**
When you find the perfect match, click "Apply" to be taken *directly* to the official application portal or national grant database (e.g., `sbir.gov`, `bpifrance.fr`, `enterprisesg.gov.sg`).
