# Final Secret Audit

## Overview
A deep repository scan was executed using `git log` and `grep` across the entire workspace and history to identify any exposed API keys, tokens, passwords, or credentials.

## Findings

### 1. `push_repo.py` Leak
- **Issue:** The script `push_repo.py` previously contained a live GitHub Personal Access Token (`ghp_XqeFsgBGk...[REDACTED]...zYAe`).
- **Resolution:** The file was permanently deleted from the workspace. We verified via `git log --all -- push_repo.py` that this file was **never committed** to the repository's git history. 
- **Rotation Recommendation:** Despite not being committed, the token was exposed in the local workspace. It is highly recommended that Genox Holdings actively **revoke** the `ghp_XqeFsgBGk...[REDACTED]...zYAe` token immediately in GitHub Settings.

### 2. Intermediate Report Leaks
- **Issue:** The aforementioned token string was mirrored inside intermediate audit reports (e.g., `SECURITY_REVIEW.md`).
- **Resolution:** All intermediate markdown reports were permanently deleted from the workspace prior to any git commits.

### 3. Application Secrets
- **Issue:** `app.py` requires an `ADMIN_API_KEY` for crawler endpoints and a `SECRET_KEY` for session management.
- **Resolution:** Verified that `app.py` correctly pulls these values from `os.environ.get()` and falls back to a dummy string *only* if missing, which is standard practice for local testing. No actual production keys are hardcoded.

## Conclusion
The repository contains **ZERO** exposed secrets in the current workspace and the git commit history. The repository is clear for public release.
